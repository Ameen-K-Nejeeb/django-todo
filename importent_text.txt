user is default django gives = sessions also like user

* from django.views.generic.list import ListView (what is this  )
-This works fine, but when your app grows, you’ll repeat this same pattern many times — for every model.
-That’s why Django gives you generic class-based views (like ListView and DetailView) — to reduce repetition.

*ListView =
=a shortcut to display multiple items (rows) from a model in a webpage

* DetailView
-Fetches a single object from the database (based on the ID or slug in the URL)
-Sends it to the template
-Uses a default context name object (or your own context_object_name)
-Uses a default template name like task_detail.html
*as_view() = It turns your class into a view function that Django can call when someone visits that URL.

---(
    ListView → shows a list of objects (like all tasks).
    DetailView → shows one specific object (like one task’s details).
    CreateView → handles adding a new record to the database.
    UpdateView → allows editing existing records.
    DeleteView → allows deleting a record.
    FormView → used for custom forms (like user registration).

    LoginView → a ready-made class view for handling login.
    LogoutView → handles user logout automatically.

from django.contrib.auth import login
Used to log in the user programmatically after registration.

*from django.contrib.auth.mixins import LoginRequiredMixin
-A mixin that restricts access to logged-in users only.
-If a user isn’t logged in, it automatically redirects them to the login page.

*from django.urls import reverse_lazy
-reverse_lazy dynamically generates URLs by view name.
-It’s “lazy” because it only resolves when needed (used in class views).

*LoginRequiredMixin → restricts view only to logged-in users.


*from django.urls import reverse_lazy
-success_url = reverse_lazy('task')
-That’s why it’s called “lazy” — it delays the resolution until the view is executed.

*pluralize is a Django template filter used to automatically add a plural suffix (usually “s”) when needed.
