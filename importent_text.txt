user is default django gives = sessions also like user

* from django.views.generic.list import ListView (what is this  )
-This works fine, but when your app grows, you’ll repeat this same pattern many times — for every model.
-That’s why Django gives you generic class-based views (like ListView and DetailView) — to reduce repetition.

*ListView =
=a shortcut to display multiple items (rows) from a model in a webpage

* DetailView
-Fetches a single object from the database (based on the ID or slug in the URL)
-Sends it to the template
-Uses a default context name object (or your own context_object_name)
-Uses a default template name like task_detail.html
*as_view() = It turns your class into a view function that Django can call when someone visits that URL.

*from django.urls import reverse_lazy
-success_url = reverse_lazy('task')
-That’s why it’s called “lazy” — it delays the resolution until the view is executed.
